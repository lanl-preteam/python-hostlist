Information for those who check out python-hostlist from git
============================================================

Having verbatim version numbers in a lot of files is cumbersome
and invites mistakes. From version 1.5, the version number
(and the release number for the RPM) is stored in the Makefile.

Before running setup.py, the files are copied into the subdirectory
"versioned" by "make prepare" (substituting #VERSION# and #RELEASE# in
the appropriate files). That target is invoked automatically when you
do "make tar" or "make rpms".

Please add similar handling of further setup.py options if they are
needed. No traces of this mechanism should be left in the generated
.tar.gz and .rpm files.

Making a release
================

*) Make sure everything is commited in git on the master branch.

*) Change VERSION and RELEASE to something indicating a test release
   (for example, 1.4.9.1 in preparation for a 1.5 release).

*) Do "make rpms" and install the resulting noarch package.

*) Run the test suite using "python test/test_hostlist.py".

*) Change VERSION to the final version number (and reset RELEASE).

*) Make sure CHANGES contains what it should.

*) Commit the changes to git, mentioning the new version number in
   the commit message ("Version 1.5." or similar).

*) Tag the new version using "git tag", prepending a lower-case "v" before
   the version number.

*) Push the master branch and the new tag to the public repository.

*) Copy versioned/dist/python-hostlist-VERSION.tar.gz to the web page
   and update the text there.

*) Upload to the Python Package Index using "make pypi".

*) Send an email to jette1@llnl.gov about the new version.
